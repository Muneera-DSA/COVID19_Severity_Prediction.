🏥 COVID-19 Mortality & Severity Prediction
Description: An end-to-end Machine Learning project using ~200,000 patient records to predict mortality risk and hospital resource needs (ICU/Intubation).

Business/Healthcare Problem: Hospitals face resource shortages during pandemic peaks. Identifying high-risk patients early allows for better resource allocation and lower mortality rates.

Objectives: > * Clean and preprocess a large-scale clinical dataset.

Build a classification model to predict mortality with high F1-Score.

Identify key risk factors (Comorbidities) using feature importance.

Results: Developed a model (XGBoost/Random Forest) that achieved an F1-Score of [Insert your score from the notebook]. The analysis revealed that Age and Pneumonia were the top predictors of mortality in this cohort.
